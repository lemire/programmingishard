## preface

I am often frustrated at how people regard programming as a lowly
task. It is not uncommon in many organizations for programmers to work
for non-programmer who assume that programming is easy. Many sentences
start with "you just have to..." and finish with a task that is far
beyond the abilities of most people. "No, you cannot just convert these
scanned pages into your favorite word processor format without introducing
errors."  

I used to think that important programming projects
required large teams with much funding, or few exceptional people.
I no longer think so. Advanced programming skills can be acquired,
they can even be acquired quickly. That's because programmers are
an ingenious bunch. More than maybe any other professional community,
they have built tools and made available their know-how, all of it
packaged in a particularly accessible way, if only you know where to look.


## Fixed-bit numbers


integers wrap or not

two's complement, division, modulo and all that

floating point numbers are not associative

can you represent the world GDP using a float in JavaScript?

## Memory access and caching

cache line

L1, L2 bla

materialized views

what does memory run slower than CPU

Ultimately limited by geometry

## Character encoding

Unicode fun

base64

## Concurrency and parallelism

races

concurrency is a problem on top

scalability is not the same as performance
