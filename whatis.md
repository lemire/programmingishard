# What is programming?

I had a colleague, a computer science professor, who was convinced 
that programming, as a professional activity, would not make it far
into the XXIst century. He did not program much, but he had
students and researchers work for him. His view was that there would
soon be software that could translate a task to be executed into
the software to be run, through artificial intelligence.

There are many views on what software programming is. But I think that
what informs us most about the nature of programming is the expression
"programming language".

Once someone has a problem to be solved by a computer, the most difficult
step, almost invariably, is to codify it using a programming language.
It is harder to do than it seems, irrespective of the programming language.
Let us take something very simple. I provide you with a string of 
characters and you tell me whether the string is a valid phone number.
Sounds easy enough? But what if the strings beings with a space character.
Can a valid phone number be allowed to starts with a space character?
Should phone numbers from Japan, Germany and the US be considered to be 
valid or do I require phone numbers from the US only. Should I checked that
it is a number that is in use, or could in use currently? And then, once 
you have written a program that does what you think it does, how do you 
know that it does what you think it does? And is it efficient, robust?
How would you test for these things?


Programming is akin to magic. You write precisely what needs
to be done, and, quite often, it will just work. However, as the world
of programming has expanded to reach far more than the underbelly of
the corporation world, but actually all of our lives, all our of universe,
programmers have to become the master magicians who represent everything
using these programming languages.

Understanding a problem vs. programming a solution for it. Both are
outcomes of a programmer's work.
