# What is programming?

I had a colleague, a computer science professor, who was convinced 
that programming, as a professional activity, would not make it far
into the XXIst century. He did not program much, but he had
students and researchers work for him. His view was that there would
soon be software that could translate a task to be executed into
the software to be run, through artificial intelligence.

There are many views on what software programming is. But I think that
what informs us most about the nature of programming is the expression
"programming language".

One someone has a problem to be solved by a computer, the most difficult
step, almost invariably, is to codify it using a programming language.
It is hard to do than it seems, irrespective of the programming language.
